        Modules
    </h2>

    <p>
        Modules play a crucial role in organizing and structuring an application. Modules are containers for different
        components, services, directives, and other code related to a specific feature or functionality. They help in
        managing the application's dependencies, code encapsulation, and separation of concerns.
    </p>
    <strong>Here are the main types of modules in Angular:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Root Module (AppModule): </strong>
            The root module, often referred to as AppModule, is the entry point of an Angular
            application. It is responsible for bootstrapping the application and importing other modules. The root
            module is created automatically when you generate a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Feature Modules:</strong>
            Feature modules are used to group related components, services, and other code that are
            dedicated to a specific feature or functionality within the application. Feature modules promote modularity
            and reusability by encapsulating the functionality within a separate module. These modules can be created
            manually using the Angular CLI or generated using schematics.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Shared Modules: </strong>
            Shared modules contain components, directives, pipes, and services that are shared across
            multiple feature modules. They help in promoting code reusability by encapsulating common functionality.
            Shared modules are typically used to export and share commonly used components, directives, and services
            among multiple modules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong> Core Module:</strong>
            The core module is a special module that contains singleton services and other components that
            are used across the application but not shared with external modules. It is responsible for providing
            application-wide services, initialization logic, and global configurations. The core module helps in keeping
            the root module clean and focused on the bootstrap process.
        </li>
    </ul>
