    <ul>
        <li>
            Routing is mechanism used by angular for navigating between page and displaying appropriated component
            /page on browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            Angular framework is mainly focused and good for the SPA (Single Pge Architecture). It loads a single
            full HTML page and dynamically loads or updates the partial pages as per user request. And, that is achieved
            with
            the help of router. A set of partial loading rule and urls is defined in router to render or load partial
            pages based on user request.
        </li>
        <li>
            Angular routing helps navigation across the application from one view to another view. It also allows
            us to maintain the state, implement modules, and load the modules based on the role of the user.
        </li>
        <li>
            In component based architecture of angular 5, Angular looks into the routes array, match the path
            as per the route requested and loads the component relevant to the requested route as well as makes
            available the relevant data for that particular route.
        </li>
        <li>
            Angular provides an easy way to create and work with components, in a single page application(SPA)
            it is essential to with multiple views/screens, navigate and communicate between them. Angular provides
            router service to manage this in a very easy way.
        </li>
        <li>
            An Angular application that uses Angular Router only has one router service service instance: It's a
            singleton. Whenever and whenever you inject the Router service in your application, you'll get access
            to the same Angular Router service instance
        </li>
    </ul>
